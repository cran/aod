Description: Provides a set of functions to analyse
        overdispersed counts or proportions. Most of the methods are
        already available elsewhere but are scattered in different
        packages. The proposed functions should be considered as
        complements to more sophisticated methods such as generalized
        estimating equations (GEE) or generalized linear mixed effect
        models (GLMM).
