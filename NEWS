      ==========================================================

NEW FEATURES

      to 2000 in the call to optim. A new argument "control" was introduces in
      the 2 functions and their help pages were amended.

BUGS

    o	A bug was corrected in the residuals method for S4 objects of class glimML
     (incorrect use of the extractor function "$" instead of "@").


      =============================================================
      CHANGES IN aod VERSION 1.1-18 (released on 13th January 2007)
      =============================================================

NEW FEATURES

    o	In negbin and betabin, display was switched to 4 digits in scientific notation.

BUGS

    o	No warning was issued when convergence was not obtained after optim iterations.
    A slot "msg" was added to fitted objects of class "glimML" to store the message
    returned by optim.

    o	An error occurred when model was fitted with hessian = FALSE.

DOCUMENTATION

    o Documentation was changed to reflect these modifications. Some messages released
    by negbin and betabin were corrected.


      ============================================================
      CHANGES IN aod VERSION 1.1-14 (released on 9th January 2007)
      ============================================================

BUGS

    o	A bug occurred when the hessian matrix was singular (overpameterized model)
    in models fitted with betabin or negbin. This was fixed. A new slot "singular.hessian"
    was added to fitted objects of class "glimML".

    o	There was a bug in the coef method for objects of class glimML when at least
    one of the explanatory variable was a factor had unused levels. To overcome
    this problem, new slots "fixed.param" and "random.param" were added to fitted
    objects of class "glimML".

DOCUMENTATION

    o Documentation was changed to reflect these modifications.


      ============================================================
      CHANGES IN aod VERSION 1.1-13 (released on 15th October 2006)
      ============================================================

      CHANGES IN aod VERSION 1.1-12 (released on 7th October 2006)

      ========================================================
      CHANGES IN aod VERSION 1.1-11 (released on 1st July 2006)
      ========================================================

NEW FEATURES

    o	The display of wald.test()'s output was slightly changed.


      =======================================================
      CHANGES IN aod VERSION 1.1-10 (released on 5th May 2006)
      =======================================================


BUGS

    o	The code of the log-likelihood function was changed in betabin and negbin to avoid
        warnings when a covariate was used to model the within-group correlation, and one of the
        "random" coeffcient was set to 0 (warnings were related to the use of ifelse).
        These warnings caused a very slow execution with R 2.3.0, probably because of some
        changes in the functions handling warnings and errors (tryCatch, etc.).


      =======================================================
      CHANGES IN aod VERSION 1.1-9 (released on 1st May 2006)
      =======================================================

        before data processing.

    o	New help page describing the package.

      CHANGES IN aod VERSION 1.1-8 (released on 20th July 2005)
      ========================================================


NEW FEATURES

    o	The number of observations was added as an attribute of the number
		returned by "logLik".

    o	The corrected AIC (AICc) was added to the output of the function "AIC" and
		included in the comparison statistics of the anova method for objects of
		formal class "glimML".

    o	A new formal class "aic" was created, with a summary method to compute
		Akaike difference and Akaike weights from a list of models to be compared.

    o	A control was added in "betabin" and "negbin" to check the presence of
		lines with null weight (thanks to Jérémy Bouyer).

    o	The show method for objects of formal class "glimML" was slightly altered:
		AICc was added to the output and a new presentation was adopted for log-
		likelihood and related statistics.


DOCUMENTATION

    o	The documentation of functions "AIC", "anova" and "logLik" was revised to
		reflect the changes in these functions.


      =======================================================
