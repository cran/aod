      CHANGES IN aod VERSION 1.1-10 (released on 5th May 2006)
      =======================================================


BUGS

    o	The code of the log-likelihood function was changed in betabin and negbin to avoid
        warnings when a covariate was used to model the within-group correlation, and one of the
        "random" coeffcient was set to 0 (warnings were related to the use of ifelse).
        These warnings caused a very slow execution with R 2.3.0, probably because of some
        changes in the functions handling warnings and errors (tryCatch, etc.).

      CHANGES IN aod VERSION 1.1-9 (released on 1st May 2006)
      =======================================================


NEW FEATURES

    o	In function splitbin(), any variable of mode character is now transformed into a factor
        before data processing.

    o	New help page describing the package.


      ========================================================
      CHANGES IN aod VERSION 1.1-8 (released on 20th July 2005)
      ========================================================


NEW FEATURES

    o	The number of observations was added as an attribute of the number
		returned by "logLik".

    o	The corrected AIC (AICc) was added to the output of the function "AIC" and
		included in the comparison statistics of the anova method for objects of
		formal class "glimML".

    o	A new formal class "aic" was created, with a summary method to compute
		Akaike difference and Akaike weights from a list of models to be compared.

    o	A control was added in "betabin" and "negbin" to check the presence of
		lines with null weight (thanks to Jérémy Bouyer).

    o	The show method for objects of formal class "glimML" was slightly altered:
		AICc was added to the output and a new presentation was adopted for log-
		likelihood and related statistics.


DOCUMENTATION

    o	The documentation of functions "AIC", "anova" and "logLik" was revised to
		reflect the changes in these functions.


      =======================================================

NEW FEATURES

    o	The slot "digits" was removed for objects of formal class anova.glimML.
